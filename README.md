1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is looking to develop a game called Draw It or Lose It, similar to the game Win, Lose, or Draw. There are 200 images that are stored and displayed for 15 seconds at a time. Play consists of two teams with multiple team members, and the team whose turn it is has 15 seconds to guess. If they cannot guess it, the other team gets a chance to guess. The goal was to design this game for multiple platforms, including mobile phones and different traditional platforms. It was previously only available on Android. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt I was able to distinguish between the advantages and disadvantages of each platform option clearly and thoroughly. The layout is clear, and the recommendations follow the given instructions step by step to give a clear picture to the reader. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helped to keep the requirements clear in my head when developing the code. It can be easy to stray as a developer from the elicited requirements, but the design document kept things organized and clear as development progressed. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The part I would change would be my initial section that was turned in at the start of the semester. I did not go back and revise it as the course progressed and I gained a better understanding. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they will be the ones actually using the product. If it is not a product they are satisfied with, there will likely be fewer sales and customers, which defeats the purpose of the Game Room trying to expand. 

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached this with the elicited requirements in mind. I made sure to stick to what was required and followed the requirements as exacting as possible for my skill level. I found the design document helpful in managing this task and would likely use this strategy again in the future.
